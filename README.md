# Revocable Anonymous Credentials

Java Revocable Anonymous Credentials (JRAC)

JRAC is a Java library for developing anonymous credential services. These services allow web users to prove in an uncorrelated way some portion of their identity attributes without revealing other details. Apart from the partial revelation of information, the library provides facilities for managing credentialsâ€™ revocation. The background idea has been inspired by the Hyperledger Ursa project (https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa).
